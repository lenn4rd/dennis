# Dennis

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/dennis`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Install it as stand-alone gem:

    $ gem install dennis

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bin/rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bin/rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
